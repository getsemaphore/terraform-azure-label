Terraform module designed to generate consistent names and tags for resources. Use `terraform-azure-label` to implement a strict naming convention.

There are 5 inputs considered "labels" or "ID elements" (because the labels are used to construct the ID):
1. namespace
1. name
1. environment
1. location_short
1. attributes

Example: org-app-prod-frc-01

This module generates IDs using the following convention by default: `{namespace}-{name}-{environment}-{location_short}-{attributes}`
However, it is highly configurable. The delimiter (e.g. `-`) is configurable. Each label item is optional (although you must provide at least one).
- The `attributes` input is actually a list of strings and `{attributes}` expands to the list elements joined by the delimiter.
- If you want the label items in a different order, you can specify that, too, with the `label_order` list.

It's recommended to use one `terraform-azure-label` module for every unique resource of a given resource type.
For example, if you have 10 instances, there should be 10 different labels.
However, if you have multiple different kinds of resources (e.g. instances, security groups, file systems, and elastic ips), then they can all share the same label assuming they are logically related.
